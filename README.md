# Tesseract Input Creator

### About
---

The Tesseract Input Creator is used to automate the creation of input files used for training a custom tesseract OCR model. It produces inputs consisting of both .tif, and .box files which can directly be fed into tesseract.

#### How To Use
---

Currently the project only exists as an exe with hard-coded parameters. Simply run
```
TesseractInputCreator <d>
```
where ```<d>``` is the directory you want the inputs saved into.
